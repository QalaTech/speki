## 2026-01-10 - US-001: Create readme_please.md with Hello DAVID World content
- What was implemented: Created readme_please.md file in repository root with Hello DAVID World content
- Files changed: readme_please.md (new file)
- Tests implemented: None required (documentation-only change)
- **Learnings:**
  - Build verification revealed pre-existing untracked WIP files with TypeScript errors (task-feedback.ts, ContextSection.tsx, KnowledgeView.tsx) - not related to this task
  - Branch switching required stashing uncommitted changes from main
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (when excluding pre-existing untracked WIP files with errors)
  - Tests: N/A (no tests for documentation change)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (5ccb3ea)

## 2026-01-10 - US-002: Create readme_please.md with hello world content
- What was implemented: Updated readme_please.md file to contain 'hello world' content (replacing previous 'Hello DAVID World' content from US-001)
- Files changed: readme_please.md (modified)
- Tests implemented: None required (documentation-only change)
- **Learnings:**
  - Sequential stories can modify the same file with different content
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS
  - Tests: N/A (no tests for documentation change)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (27136ea)

## 2026-01-10 - US-003: Create readme_please.md with hello world content
- What was implemented: Verified that readme_please.md already exists with correct content (work completed in US-002)
- Files changed: None (work already complete from previous story)
- Tests implemented: None required (documentation-only change)
- **Learnings:**
  - Duplicate tasks can occur in PRD - verify existing state before implementing
  - Pre-existing WIP changes in web/src/components/LiveExecutionView.tsx cause build failures when included
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (when excluding pre-existing unrelated WIP files)
  - Tests: N/A (no tests for documentation change)
  - Commit: N/A (no new changes - work already committed in 27136ea)

## 2026-01-10 - US-004: Create readme_please.md with hello world content
- What was implemented: Verified that readme_please.md already exists with correct content (work completed in US-002)
- Files changed: None (work already complete from previous story)
- Tests implemented: None required (documentation-only change)
- **Learnings:**
  - This is the third duplicate task for the same file - PRD contained multiple identical stories
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (core TypeScript - web project has pre-existing WIP errors unrelated to this task)
  - Tests: N/A (no tests for documentation change)
  - Commit: N/A (no new changes - work already committed in 27136ea)

## 2026-01-10 - US-005: Create readme_please.md with hello world content
- What was implemented: Verified that readme_please.md already exists with correct content (work completed in US-002)
- Files changed: None (work already complete from previous story)
- Tests implemented: None required (documentation-only change)
- **Learnings:**
  - This is the fourth duplicate task for the same file - PRD contained multiple identical stories (US-001, US-002, US-003, US-004, US-005)
  - Build system now fully passing (including web project) - previous WIP issues appear resolved
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (both core TypeScript and web project)
  - Tests: N/A (no tests for documentation change)
  - Commit: N/A (no new changes - work already committed in 27136ea)
