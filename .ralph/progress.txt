## Codebase Patterns

- **TypeScript Type Definitions**: All shared types defined in `src/types/index.ts`, using interfaces for object shapes and type aliases for unions
- **Spec Review Module**: Located in `src/core/spec-review/` - contains focused modules for spec review functionality
- **Test Location**: Unit tests co-located with code in `__tests__` directories (e.g., `src/core/spec-review/__tests__/`)
- **Async File Operations**: Use `fs/promises` for async file system operations
- **Project Type Detection Order**: Check package.json first (nodejs), then requirements.txt/pyproject.toml (python), go.mod (go), *.csproj (dotnet)

## 2026-01-11 - US-022: Implement error handling for CLI not available
- What was implemented: Added CLI availability checking with installation instructions when CLI (claude or codex) is not installed
- Files changed:
  - src/core/cli-path.ts (modified, +52 lines - added checkCliAvailable, getInstallInstructions, CliAvailabilityResult)
  - src/cli/commands/spec.ts (modified, +8 lines - added CLI check before running review)
  - src/core/__tests__/cli-path.test.ts (new, 97 lines)

- **Learnings:**
  - Use clearTimeout for both timeoutId and sigkillTimeoutId in close handler to prevent memory leaks
  - Track completedPromptNames array during iteration, only add prompt name after successful completion (not timeout)
  - Break loop on first timeout - remaining prompts would likely timeout too
  - formatTimeoutMs handles both seconds and minutes formatting with proper pluralization
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - TypeCheck: PASS (npx tsc --noEmit)
  - Tests: PASS (86/86 spec-review and spec CLI tests)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (7c2c57a)

## 2026-01-11 - US-024: Integrate --review flag with decompose command
- What was implemented: Modified decompose command to use runDecomposeReview (focused prompts, no tools) when --review flag is set
- Files changed:
  - src/core/decompose/runner.ts (modified - integrated runDecomposeReview, added reviewTimeoutMs option, code simplified with runClaudeWithPrompt helper)

  - Code simplifier extracted runClaudeWithPrompt helper to consolidate duplicate spawn logic between runClaudeDecompose and reviseTasksWithFeedback
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - TypeCheck: PASS (npx tsc --noEmit)
  - Tests: PASS (67/67 decompose and spec-review tests)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (09bbbe5)

## 2026-01-11 - US-026: Implement dynamic loop limit calculation
- What was implemented: Fixed calculateLoopLimit function to return 0 for zero tasks (was incorrectly returning 5), added comprehensive test suite
- Files changed:
  - src/core/ralph-loop/loop-limit.ts (modified - removed incorrect zero-case handling)
  - src/core/ralph-loop/__tests__/loop-limit.test.ts (new, 21 lines)
- Tests implemented:
  - calculateLoopLimit_With10ExistingTasks_Returns12 - PASS
  - calculateLoopLimit_With20Existing5New_Returns30 - PASS
  - calculateLoopLimit_With0Tasks_Returns0 - PASS
  - calculateLoopLimit_WithFractionalResult_RoundsUp - PASS

## 2026-01-11 - US-027: Integrate dynamic loop limit with task executor
- What was implemented: Modified start.ts CLI to use getter function instead of static value, added onTasksChanged callback to LoopOptions, implemented recalculation when PRD is reloaded with more tasks
- Files changed:
  - src/cli/commands/start.ts (modified - uses getMaxIterations getter, passes onTasksChanged callback)
  - src/core/ralph-loop/runner.ts (modified - added onTasksChanged to LoopOptions, calls it when task count increases)
  - src/core/ralph-loop/__tests__/runner.test.ts (new, 227 lines)
- Tests implemented:
  - taskExecutor_UsesDynamicLimit - PASS
  - taskExecutor_RecalculatesOnTaskAddition - PASS
  - taskExecutor_AllTasksFitInWindow - PASS
- **Learnings:**
  - Runner already supported dynamic maxIterations via getter function - just needed to wire it up in CLI
  - Used optional callback pattern (onTasksChanged?.) for recalculation notification
  - Server routes already had similar implementation via runningLoop.updateMaxIterations - CLI was missing this
  - Test mocking for runClaude requires full RunResult with parsed: { fullText, toolCalls, isComplete }
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - Tests: PASS (7/7 ralph-loop tests)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (ee1ccdb)

  - POST_start_InitiatesReview - PASS
  - GET_status_ReturnsResults - PASS
  - POST_split_CreatesFiles - PASS
  - POST_splitPreview_ReturnsPreview - PASS
- **Learnings:**
  - Use dynamic mockProjectPath variable for tests that need different project paths - declare at module level and reset in beforeEach
  - detectGodSpec requires CodebaseContext as second argument - pass empty context for preview functionality
  - Route files follow pattern: router.use(projectContext(true)) to require project context middleware
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - Tests: PASS (12/12 spec-review routes tests)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (0ff8db3)

  - Promise.then() with success/failure handlers is cleaner for boolean conversion: `access(path).then(() => true, () => false)`
  - Session routes reuse the existing session-file.ts module functions for consistency
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - Tests: PASS (6/6 sessions routes tests, 29/29 server tests total)

  - For feedback endpoint, action parameter uses 'approved'/'rejected'/'edited' values (matching SuggestionStatus type)
  - Revert endpoint writes file content using fs.writeFile and marks change as reverted in session
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build including web)
  - Tests: PASS (18/18 spec-review routes tests, 35/35 server tests total)
  - Commit: SUCCESS (d6ea4ad)

  - Clamp panel width between min/max (20%-80%) to prevent panels from collapsing completely
  - Use aria-orientation="vertical" and role="separator" for accessible resize handles
  - When useEffect fetches data and sets initial selection, avoid including the selection in the dependency array to prevent re-fetches
- **Verification:**
  - Build: PASS (npm run build)
