# Left to do
- [x] Find the best way to handle suggestions, still not sold.
- [ ] Editing stories is clunky and doesnt work, need to think of a good way to handle this.
- [ ] Need to test what its like getting tech spec tasks ran and how the feedback to the user looks.
- [ ] Need to hookup the model selector in the chat.
- [ ] Need to decide whether we keep the + in the chat input given its got no utility right now.
